# HabitatAnnotation
Habitat annotation of horizontally facing benthic imagery from baited and unbaited remote stereo-video deployments and diver swum stereo-video transects.

We have developed an simple approach to characterise the composition and complexity of habitats, using horizontally facing benthic imagery adapting existing standardised schema for benthic composition (CATAMI classification scheme<sup>1</sup>) and benthic complexity<sup>2</sup>, with the addition of a class to quantify the % of benthos within the horizontally facing imagery. The annotation approach is rapid and produces % composition and mean and standard deviation estimates of complexity which enable flexible modeling of habitat occurrence and habitat-fish relationships.

This annotation schema is described and included in a published paper<sup>3</sup>, please cite if you use it.
However, please refer to this GitHub repository for uptodate versions of the annotation schema.

Parts of this annotation scheme have also been trailed in two further published papers so far<sup>4,5</sup>.
