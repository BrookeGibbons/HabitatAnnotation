# HabitatAnnotation
Habitat annotation of BRUV and DOV imagery

We have developed an simple approach to characterise the composition and complexity of habitats, using horizontally facing benthic imagery adapting existing standardised schema for benthic composition (CATAMI classification scheme<sup>1) and benthic complexity, with the addition of a class to quantify the % of benthos within the horizontally facing imagery. The annotation approach is rapid and produces % composition and mean and standard deviation estimates of complexity which enable flexible modeling of habitat occurrence and habitat-fish relationships which we have successfully applied to three publications this year
